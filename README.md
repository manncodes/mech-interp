<h3 align="center">MECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY AND GROKKING PHENOMENON IN TRANSFORMER MODELS</h3>

---

<p align="center"> This project is a part of the course project for CSCI 567: Machine Learning at USC. In this project, we explore the interpretability of transformer models and try to understand the phenomenon of grokking in transformer models on algorithmic tasks.
